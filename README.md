# aerospace-tools

A set of scripts for undergraduate-level aerospace engineering class work. The compressible flow scripts are inspired by the [Compressible Aerodynamics Calculator](http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3114/calc.html) and my interest in having something similar available on a TI-84 Plus CE-T Python Edition calculator.

The `max-q.py` script is a modified version of the script from chapter 3 of [_Python for Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering_ by Alex Kenan](https://github.com/alexkenan/pymae) which includes a pitch maneuver and acceleration calculations based on drag and vehicle mass as a function of time.
